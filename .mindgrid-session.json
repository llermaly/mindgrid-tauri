I want to make a good first impression._\n\nHey! I’m here and ready to help.  \n\nYou’ve got a Tauri desktop app that should mirror the `prototypes` HTML and reuse ideas from the `crystal` Electron app (read‑only).  \n\nWhat would you like to work on first—UI layout, a specific feature to port from `crystal`, or setting up some new logic in Tauri?\n\nUsage — In: 7151, Out: 95",
