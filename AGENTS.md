# Rules

The goal of this project is to create a desktop app based on `crystal` folder project but with new features.

You can't write on `crystal` folder, it is only to read features and migrate to Tauri

Crystal app is in Electron, and I want to port some parts of the app to Tauri for better performance.

In the `prototypes` folder you will find a HTML version of how I want the app to look.

Generally speaking we want to migrate feature by feature to have a clean environment to work with
